                    W.E.F 4th Nov 2024 <br />
                    <br />
                    Bikat Adventures has always believed in growing as a community of adventure enthusiasts and takes pride in the people who have been on expeditions with us. We believe in establishing a personal connect with all our
                    participants and our secretly famous &lsquo;After trek or expedition parties&rsquo; are a testimony to our Endeavour in this area. With Bikat Adventures growing by the day into a larger organization, we feel grateful
                    towards this &ldquo;Bikat Community&rdquo; who has been a significant reason behind our success and growth. Here&rsquo;s launching the Membership and Loyalty program targeted at the Bikat Community&hellip;
                </p>
                <p>The purpose of this membership plan is not to lure you into something but just as a gesture of <em>Thanks. </em>Here are the questions that you need answers for:</p>
                <p><strong>Who is eligible for the memberships?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you booked at least 3 expeditions days* with us, then consider yourself eligible!</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>When you say days on expedition, Are all your events called expedition or is there any criteria for that?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An expedition would be defined as any trekking, cycling, rock climbing, or mountaineering trip with a minimum duration of 3 days</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How would the expedition days be counted? Would the travel time also be included?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Expedition days would be counted from the standard itinerary published by Bikat Adventures&rsquo; website. In case there is additional travel involved to reach the starting point, then that would not be counted.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How many types of memberships do you have?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The membership would be offered at 3 levels
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Basic (2 year)</strong> &ndash; With at least 3 expedition days under your belt, you get a free membership for a period of 2 years from the date of invitation</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Summiter (5 year)</strong> &ndash; A Basic level member with 12 more expedition days with us, can upgrade to a &lsquo;Summiter&rsquo; level membership. Or if you have completed 15 expedition days with
                                us and forgot to become Basic member, then also you can become a Summiter directly by applying afresh. As a Summiter, you get a free membership for a period of 5 years from the date of invitation.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Leader (Lifetime)</strong> &ndash; A Summiter who completes 20 more expedition days with us, would be given a free lifetime membership.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What are the various benefits attached to memberships?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The various benefits involve <strong>Inaugural Voucher, Regular Discounts, Power to Refer &amp; win Vouchers, </strong>The benefits applicable to all the membership plans are similar but the validity/quantum may be
                        different.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What is an Inaugural Voucher?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    With every new invitation for membership, we give you a discount voucher worth INR 2000 (Inaugural Voucher) that can be redeemed in any of our expeditions within a period of 6 months from the date of completion of most
                    recent expedition. The idea is to help more and more people in using this voucher without damaging parity between prompt and occasional users. So, the validity shall be extended whenever it expires with a deduction of
                    10% for another 6 months. Like this, the voucher actually never expires but incentivizes those who are frequent explorers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The deduction would be 10% for every elapsed period of 6 months from last date of the most recently completed trek. For eg. In case your inaugural voucher worth INR 2000/- is expiring on 4th July 2016 and last time you
                    completed a trek with us was from 1st January till 3rd January 2016, then the voucher would be extended with a deduction of 20% of the present value of the voucher i.e. INR 400/- and a new voucher worth INR 1600, valid
                    till 3rd January 2017.
                </p>
                <p>Please note that this extension policy is valid only for Inaugural vouchers and not for any other voucher whatsoever.</p>
                <p><strong>How do I Accumulate Discounts each time I trek?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Every active member would get <em><u>Bikat Vouchers</u></em> worth certain %age of the expedition fee, every time he/she books an expedition with us. The vouchers are like cash back and we call them Booking Vouchers
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Basic Member (5%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summiter Member (7%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leader Member (10%)</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Please note that the booking vouchers, as explained above are, are generated on the amount paid by a member for him/herself. In case you are making a group booking from your ID, then you would get the booking voucher
                    only for your own amount and not the others who are part of the booking.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Can I also gift or transfer a voucher to one of my friends?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The vouchers can be redeemed by anyone having the voucher code. So, you can gift your vouchers to your friends or relatives who can use them for any of our expeditions. Just use the &ldquo;Gift a voucher&rdquo; tab
                        on your dashboard.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How do I earn more using Referrals?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can refer friends or anyone for that matter. Use the &ldquo;Refer a friend&rdquo; tab on your dashboard to refer for any of our expeditions and get additional
                        <strong>vouchers worth 10% of the Expedition fees.</strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Is there any condition for referrals?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The only condition is that the people they are referring should not already be a member of Bikat Adventures community and the expedition that you are referring for should of minimum 3 days.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>When would any voucher become active for me? At the time of booking or after the expedition?</strong></p>
                <ul>

                        Except for Inaugural voucher, all other vouchers are activated immediately at the time of generation i.e. booking an expedition. However, Inaugural voucher would be activated only after the expedition is complete and
                        the participant has finally been part of the team attempting the expedition.

                <p>
                    <b><u>Facilitate your trek plans</u></b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    “I am student and want to go to Pin Parvati pass but the cost ranges between 20 – 30 grand and I don’t have that kind of money at hand” said Kusum Sharma, a student from IIT Delhi. The problem of lack of cash is not
                    something that only students face. This is a situation faced by many of us on a regular basis when planning for long expeditions. Now either you use a credit card and make EMIs after the expedition is over or you plan
                    for the expedition in advance and accumulate savings. If you want to choose the 2nd way, then these vouchers would suit you best.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b><u>Gifting the best of experiences</u></b>
                </p>

                <p><i>“Gift me gold, gift me diamond and I can sell them away. Gift me an experience, and its mine forever”</i> By someone like you and us.</p>

                <p>
                    Isn’t it so true! Bikat vouchers offer you a unique way to gift your friends, family, and loved ones. Gift them an experience of adventure that they can never forget. we deliver your gifted vouchers by email or courier,
                    whichever way you suggest us. The vouchers would carry a personal message from your side, can be digitally submitted or handwritten, making it that bit more special for your loved one. In fact, why just loved ones! Gift
                    it to anyone, from your bosses to 1st crush to even your enemies! Because any adventure expedition with the Bikats is always refreshing and reflective at the same time, and anyone with the Bikats would vouch for this:)
                </p>

                <p class="text-warning">So why should I buy Bikat Vouchers</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Easy to buy/gift and easy to redeem. Everything is managed on our website seamlessly.</li>
                    <li>With a time limit of 1 year from the date of purchase.</li>
                    <li>One voucher can be used in one booking only with complete voucher  amount usage</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-warning">How to use the vouchers?</p>
                <p>You can use the voucher to book any of our expeditions.</p>
                <p class="text-warning">What are general terms related to the vouchers?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A voucher once redeemed or expired would not be valid for any other transaction</li>
                    <li>A Bikat voucher can only be redeemed with Bikat Adventures</li>
                    <li>All voucher codes would be unique and generated by Bikat Adventures</li>
                    <li>Vouchers are applicable only for treks in India unless it is a cancellation voucher issued against the Nepal Treks.</li>
                    <li>One can redeem only 25% of the core trek /event fee using a "Merged" voucher, irrespective of the value of the Voucher.</li>
                    <li>Vouchers cannot be clubbed with any promotional offer or running discount to book an event.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-warning">Can I use the voucher multiple times?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No. The voucher can be used only once and thereafter the code would stand invalid.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-warning">What is the Validity of these vouchers?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The validity would be mentioned for each voucher specifically</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-warning">What happens if I use part amount from the voucher?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you redeem a voucher for part amount, then the remaining amount would not be refunded by Bikat Adventures. Well, not that we like to keep the change but the process is bit too complicated to manage operationally!
                        For eg. If you are booking a trek worth INR 10000, and you redeem a voucher worth 15000, then you would lose a sum of INR 5000. So we suggest that you use your voucher wisely while booking a trek.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-warning">I used my voucher to make a booking but I had to later cancel the same. Do I retain my voucher?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In case of voluntary cancellation of booking by the participant, the voucher cannot be revived.</li>
                    <li>In case of cancellation of the expedition by Bikat Adventures due to weather or any other unforeseen issues, the voucher codes would be reactivated by us within 7 working days.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-warning">What should I do if I am facing issues with my vouchers or while redeeming them?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In case of any difficulty in redeeming the vouchers online, you can write to us with a reference to your voucher code at <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ec9f999c9c839e98ac8e85878d988d889a898298999e899fc28f8381">[email&#160;protected]</a></li>
