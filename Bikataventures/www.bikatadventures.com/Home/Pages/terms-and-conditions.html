                </p>
                <h5>1. Insurance</h5>
                <p>Adequate and valid outdoor insurance is a mandatory requirement for all international (Non-Indian) and domestic (Indian) participants. The same should be obtained before the date of departure.</p>
                <h5><strong>2. How to Book</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    To make a booking,&nbsp;you can contact us through email/phone, our website <a href="../../index.html">www.bikatadventures.com</a>, or through an approved travel agent. The person making the booking must
                    be 18 years old or over and must&nbsp; possess the legal capacity and authority to make the booking. If one person is making the booking on behalf of other people then after the booking of the event, other people will
                    also be required to take the undertaking of accepting the terms and conditions mentioned in this agreement. <strong>All international (Non-Indian) participants</strong> may also be required to pay for any
                    <strong>non-</strong>transferable and non-refundable <strong>items</strong>&nbsp; such as National Park entrance fees and Permits as per the requirements of the particular Park/permits applicable for
                    <strong>all international (Non-Indian) participants</strong>..
                </p>
                <p>When any event is booked through an approved travel agent, all communication/changes/enquiry in relation to the event will only be accepted through the travel agent only.</p>
                <p>
                    After the acceptance of the booking, the company will issue a confirmation invoice to you. You are advised to please go through the confirmation invoice carefully&nbsp;and inform the company of any changes, if required
                    to be made. Names and identity proof provided by you must be legally valid and self attested.&nbsp;Travel documents/itinerary will be sent or emailed to you well in time before the departure of your tour, but will not be
                    issued unless payment of the due balance has been received and any pending cheques have been cleared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your personal safety is of paramount importance to us and therefore it is imperative that you inform us in writing,&nbsp;at the time of booking, of any condition (medical or otherwise) that needs any special
                    care/attention and that might affect your or other people&rsquo;s experience during the event. You agree to provide any/all information that may be asked by government authorities / border control / security agencies for
                    the purpose of security and counter terrorism. This is known as Advance Passenger Information. The information you must provide will include, but not be limited to, full name &ndash; as shown in your passport or travel
                    document, gender, age, nationality, travel document type, and number. For Indian nationals, this information may be provided only for the person making the booking (lead booking participant) but for Non Indian nationals,
                    the same might be asked from all participants.
                </p>
                <p>2.1 <strong>In case of booking with Partial Amount</strong></p>

                    the balance payment is not made at least 30 days prior to the departure date, then the booking would be deemed cancelled and Bikat Adventures would not be liable towards any cash refund. However, you can request for a
                    voucher refund and the same would be treated as per the cancellation policy (refer clause 3.1.2).
                </p>
                <h5>3.&nbsp;Prices, Surcharging and Refund Situations &nbsp; &nbsp;</h5>
                <p>
                    Prices (for all events) are updated regularly on our website but the company reserves the right to change the prices from time to time. There might be temporary offers &amp; promotions running from time to time and the
                    company reserves all rights to introduce or withdraw any offer or promotion at any time without any prior intimation. However, those who have already booked using any promotion or offer would not be affected.
                </p>
                <p><strong>3.1.1&nbsp; &nbsp; Change/Cancellation of&nbsp;Booking by&nbsp;participant</strong></p>
                <p>
                    3.1.1.&nbsp; Process &ndash; The cancellation process is completely automated. Please login to your Bikat account and find relevant instructions on your dashboard. You can choose your preferred mode of refund
                    (Cash/Voucher) as per the policy below and your refund would automatically be processed by the system. In case of any issue write back to us at <a href="../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="83f0f6f3f3ecf1f7c3e1eae8e2f7e2e7f5e6edf7f6f1e6f0ade0ecee">[email&#160;protected]</a> and we will process your cancellation request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3.1.2.&nbsp; Replacement of participant(s)</strong> &ndash; Our system allows you to seamlessly replace any of the participants in your booking through the Bikat login account dashboard. Please note that this
                    feature is applicable only when the status of the Booking is &ldquo;Paid&rdquo; and there are at least 10 days remaining prior to the departure date (departure date minus 10). The new participant needs to print, sign,
                    scan and send the undertaking form to <a href="../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#a2cbccc4cde2c0cbc9c3d6c3c6d4c7ccd6d7d0c7d18cc1cdcf"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="731a1d151c33111a181207121705161d07060116005d101c1e">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that the replacement would not be applicable on any Volvo/Train transport booked for the original participant. The same would be automatically cancelled. This is simply because the seats booked in such
                    transport mediums are not transferrable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3.1.3.&nbsp; Cash Refund:</strong>&nbsp; Cash refund is applicable only in case of bookings made without any discount (promotional code/voucher/dynamic discount). Also, the cash refunds would not be applicable in
                    case of shifted batch bookings & if the status of the Booking is "Booked". "Cash Refund will be processed in 7-14 working days."
                </p>
                <p>The Refund of the amount would be processed as per deduction guidelines outlined in table below:</p>
                <p>
                    All cancellation refunds will be processed back to the bank account or the credit card account from which the event fee has been paid. The amount for refund processing would always be calculated basis the
                    <strong><em>net amount paid* </em></strong>for booking the event w.r.t the Base Price of the event (including additional components like transport, rent, portage, etc.).
                </p>
                <p><strong>3.1.4.&nbsp; Voucher Refund: </strong>This option is available for all types of bookings including the bookings made under promotional offers & using Cancellation Vouchers.</p>
                <p>
                    Bikat Adventures would offer you a short term voucher that would enable you with a flexibility to book any other Bikat event using the voucher.&nbsp;The option of claiming a voucher is available till 10 day prior to the
                    departure of the event.&nbsp;
                    <strong><em>Bikat Vouchers are only applicable for treks in India & not applicable for Nepal treks unless the refund voucher is issued due to cancellation of Nepal treks.&nbsp;</em></strong> The Refund of the amount
                    would be processed as per deduction guidelines outlined in table below:

                <p>
                    The amount for refund processing would always be calculated basis the <strong><em>net amount paid* </em></strong>for booking the event w.r.t the Base Price of the event (including additional components like transport,
                    rent, portage, etc.). Please note that the voucher issued would not include the service tax amount paid while making the booking. However, when you use the voucher to book again on our website, service tax would not be
                    applicable on the voucher amount. Validity of the voucher would be 24 months from the date of issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong><em>*Net Amount Paid</em></strong> would be the amount paid to Bikat Adventures at the time of booking after adjusting for all rebates provided by applying vouchers.
                </p>
                <p><em>All addons bookings are completely refundable, be it cash or voucher refund as per the refund slab & timeline. </em></p>

                <p><em>* The voucher can not be clubbed with any other promotional offer/discount</em><em>.</em></p>

                <p><strong>3.2. In case of Cancellation or change initiated by Bikat Adventures</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Bikat adventures reserves the right to cancel your booking or change any of the facilities, services or prices described in our brochures or website. We will endeavor to advise you of any changes known at the time of
                    booking. We plan the arrangements for your events many months in advance and may occasionally have to make minor changes.. Transport timings and carriers shown or communicated on our website are for guidance only and are
                    subject to change. We will send you the final itinerary closer to the departure dates (2-3 days prior) along with the tickets (wherever applicable).
                </p>
                <p>
                    However in the field of adventure activities, there are many variables beyond our control like weather conditions, landslides, road situations and any other force majeure conditions. Circumstances amounting to "force
                    majeure" include any event which we or the supplier of the service(s) in question could not even with all due care, foresee or forestall such as (by way of example and not by way of limitation) war, threat of war, riots,
                    civil disturbances, industrial disputes, actual or threatened terrorist activity and its consequences, natural or nuclear disasters, fire, epidemics, health risks and pandemics, acts of God, unavoidable and unforeseeable
                    technical problems with transport for reasons beyond our control or that of our suppliers, closed or congested airports or ports, hurricanes and other actual or potential adverse weather conditions, and any other similar
                    events. In such situations we might be forced to change the itinerary or even cancel an event. In case of a change /cancellation, you will have the choice of either:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>accepting a replacement event from us of equivalent or similar standard and price (at the date of the change), if we are able to offer you one; or</li>
                    <li>Cancelling your event, in which case you shall receive a full refund*, including all the components paid by you (transport, base fee, taxes).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    *The refund would always be in the form of a voucher (validity 12 months) if the change or cancellation arises from circumstances amounting to &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; or from any other reason beyond our control.
                    However, for cancellations made otherwise, the participant would have a choice between voucher of 24 month validity or cash refund. Please note that in case you have made the booking using a voucher, cash refund would
                    only be made for the part paid in cash. However, we will reactivate your consumed voucher with an additional validity of 12 month.
                </p>
                <p><strong>3.3&nbsp; In case of changes/cancellation of the event after departure,</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3.3.1</strong> When the change or cancellation arise from circumstances amounting to &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; or for any other reason beyond our control Bikat Adventures shall not be liable to refund the
                    amount already deposited.
                </p>
                <p><strong>3.4 In case of drop out by the participant in between the event</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We shall not be liable to make any refund in such situation. The participant would also have to pay additionally for unplanned expenses on planning and executing the retreat of the participant on actual basis. In case
                    suitable arrangements for retreat are not possible, Bikat Adventures reserves the right to deny such drop out in between the event.
                </p>
                <p><strong>3.5 In case of Emergency Evacuation</strong></p>
                <p>
                    While we do have first aid and experts available on all our events but still there might be situations under which an emergency evacuation might be needed. We are committed to make a safe evacuation for you in case of an
                    emergency. We would make necessary and adequate arrangements for your evacuation till the nearest road head that is well connected by road, and would also help you in boarding a vehicle to the nearest Hospital or any
                    other facility so required. Any additional expenses incurred, that of porters, vehicle, ambulance, hospitalization, or any other expense incurred for evacuation, would be covered by the participant.
                </p>
                <h5>4. Visa, Health, Passport, Travel Documentation</h5>
                <p>
                    Whilst we are able to provide basic advice/information to clients regarding passports and visa requirements, it will be your sole responsibility you are required to check/verify with the appropriate embassy or the
                    consulate for the exact requirements for your chosen event and date of travel. We cannot accept responsibility for any failure to comply resulting in any costs or fines being incurred.
                </p>
                <h5>5. Local Laws &amp; Customs</h5>
                <p>
                    Laws and customs of the areas we visit can be very different to those we are used to. Be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend, especially if you are visiting religious areas. It is your responsibility
                    to familiarize yourself with, and respect local laws and customs. If you fail to do so, we will have no liability to you for any cost, loss or damage which you suffer nor will we refund you the cost of any unused portion
                    of your travel arrangements.
                </p>
                <h5>6. Privacy Policy</h5>
                <p>
                    We are committed to not pass your information unnecessarily. Bikat Adventures would use your info to make your experience a better one but incase required for safety or arrangement purposes, we might have to forward your
                    contact details to relevant vendors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During all our expeditions, we click pictures, record videos, and create other intellectual property. Such content may feature you in many cases. Unless specified otherwise by a participant, we shall deem the permission
                    granted for using such creative content created on our events.
                </p>
                <p>We also encourage you to share the pictures or videos that you create on your own. We give due credits before publishing such content on public platforms.</p>
                <h5>7. Leader Authority &amp; Behaviour</h5>
                <p>
                    On any event, it is necessary that you abide by the authority of the leader, who represents the Company. If you commit any illegal act when on the event or if in reasonable opinion of the leader or another person in
                    authority your behaviour is disruptive, threatening or abusive, causes unnecessary inconvenience or is causing or likely to cause damage to property, danger, distress or upset, disturbance or annoyance to others or puts
                    any other traveler or our staff in any risk or danger, on the telephone, in writing or in person, we may terminate your travel arrangements without any liability on our part. Any form of intoxication, by means of
                    alcohol, illicit drugs, weed, or hash, is completely banned on all expeditions. The observation &amp; assessment of the Leader would be final in this regard and any traces/indication found would deem the participant
                    unfit to continue further. The leader has complete authority to terminate your expedition in such a case. In any of these circumstances no refunds or compensation will be paid to you and we will not be liable for any
                    costs or expenses you incur.
                </p>
                <h5>8. Your Accommodation</h5>
                <p>
                    Any accommodation we arrange for you, must only be used by those people named on your Confirmation Invoice. You are not allowed to share the accommodation or let anyone else stay there. You are responsible for the cost
                    of any damage caused to your accommodation or its contents during your stay. These charges must be met by you and may have to be paid locally.
                </p>
                <h5>9. Special Requests</h5>
                <p>
                    We will consider special requests such as dietary requirements or specific rooming arrangements when you book. We will tell you whether there is a charge for the request. We can only guarantee requests for which there is
                    a charge, or those that are confirmed in writing. It is your responsibility to advise us of any special requirements through email after you confirm your booking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One special request that we get on most of our trekking events is carrying of backpacks on mules / porters. We highly recommend that the personal backpack be carried by the participant themselves because your rucksack
                    can be a life saver in the mountains when faced with unforeseen situations. However, in case a person is absolutely not able to carry or is feeling sick, he/she can offload by paying a charge as per the rates mentioned
                    on the trek page:
                </p>

                <p>* Each bag should not be more than 12 Kg in weight. This weight limit is a reference for maximum weight but bags shall be counted in number to calculate the charges.</p>
                <p>
                    # Partial offloading is not allowed i.e. number of days would be counted as the total duration of the trek/expedition no matter when you offload during the expedition. In case of expeditions where there are additional
                    days required for reverse logistics, then 1 or 2 days may be added to the total duration of the expedition.
                </p>
                <h5>10. Participation Requirements</h5>
                <p>
                    All clients are expected to satisfy themselves prior to booking that they are fit and able to complete the itinerary of their chosen event as described in the itinerary. No unaccompanied minors (those under 18 years of
                    age) can be accepted however minors aged between 10 -17 years may accompany their parent or guardian who accepts full responsibility for them. Anyone suffering from mobility impairment, illness or disability or
                    undergoing treatment for any physical or mental condition, must declare the true nature of such condition at the time of booking and make arrangements for the provision of any medication or other treatment which may be
                    required during the event. Failure to make such disclosure will constitute a breach of these booking conditions and result in such persons being excluded from the event in which case all monies paid will be forfeit.
                    Please contact us if you wish to find out more information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All participants are also expected to have read and understood the eligibility criteria of the expedition they are signing up for. They are clearly mentioned on our itinerary page (under FAQs section). At the time of
                    start of the expedition, they must meet the criteria fully (fitness &amp; experience). In case our ground staff finds that the participant is not meeting any of the criteria (fitness or experience) desired for the
                    expedition, they can simply refuse the participation at any stage during or before the expedition. In such case, Bikat Adventures or its staff shall not be responsible for any refund of any kind of fee paid by the
                    participant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For expeditions that involve road journey or travel, participants are advised to take utmost care of the road safety norms. Any indiscipline regarding road safety or risky riding/driving by the participant may force our
                    team to restrict/suspend/terminate the participant&rsquo;s ride/drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All equipment issued to the participants at the start of any expedition should be maintained and responsibly used by them at all times during the expedition. Any damage or loss of equipment issued by Bikat Adventures to
                    the participant, shall make the participant liable to compensate for the loss/damage.
                </p>
                <h5>11.&nbsp; Law &amp; Jurisdiction</h5>
                <p>
                    If any dispute or difference(s) of any kind whatsoever shall arise between the parties hereto in connection with or arising out of this agreement the parties hereto shall in good faith negotiate with a view to arriving
                    at an amicable resolution and settlement
                </p>
